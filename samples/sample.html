    <p>The Morris dance is common to all inhabited
    worlds in the multiverse.
    </p>
    <p>It is danced under blue skies to celebrate the quickening of
    the soil and under bare stars because it's springtime and with any
    luck the carbon dioxide will unfreeze again. The imperative is
    felt by deep-sea beings who have never seen the sun and urban
    humans whose only connection with the cycles of nature is that
      their Volvo once ran over a sheep.
