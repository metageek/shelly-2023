  <h1 class="shelly">Shelly 2023</h1>
  <p>This is a font based on the calligraphy in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lettersbyshells/?hl=en">Shelly
    Kim</a>'s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Lettering-Modern-Calligraphy-Step/dp/1631597205">Digital Hand Lettering
        and Modern Calligraphy</a></i>. It's a loose adaptation; the
    book shows a
more cursive hand, with all the letters joined up. That style has its
good points, but it's not what I wanted to do.
  </p>

  <p>Here's some sample text: <span class="shelly">The quick brown fox
  jumps over the lazy dog.</span> I have
  a <a href="samples/sample.html">longer sample</a>, too. And, if your
  browser doesn't show you the sample text in this font, you can see
  <a href="samples/Shelly.pdf">the PDF</a>.
  </p>

  <p>As of release 0.2 (15 July 2023), this font supports all of
    Latin-1 (that is,
    the characters used in Western European languages), and has a few
    ligatures. I intend to add more accented characters, and maybe
    some more ligatures. I have kerning for the plain ASCII letters, but not
    for the accented ones; a future release of the font will probably
    add that, which will change the layout of documents using the
    font.
